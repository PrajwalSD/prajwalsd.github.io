        <h1>Good monitor for a MacBook Pro</h1>

    </header><p>I spend most of my time working on a code editor or a browser on my MacBook Pro (2017 model). Essentially all I consume at work on a computer screen is just characters mostly.</p>
<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I never felt a need for a dedicated work setup at home, but this one didn&rsquo;t seem like it was here to go anytime soon from our lives. So, I started looking for a <em>perfect</em> companion monitor for my laptop. To me, the definition of the word <em>perfect</em> here was apparent — it should be able to render/display text very well, like really well, rest was a bonus.</p>
<p>The obvious choice was to go for one of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/sg_smb_5200/shop/product/HMUB2PA/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display">Apple approved 4K/5K Ultrafine family of monitors made by LG</a> as a companion monitor for the MacBook Pro but my wallet didn&rsquo;t like the idea of it. So, my hunt for this <em>perfect</em> monitor continued, and after weeks of reading (and watching tons of monitor reviews) I was convinced that a <em>perfect</em> monitor doesn&rsquo;t exist for my budget.</p>
<p>Then I came across <a href="https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-32UN880-B">31.5'' UltraFine™ UHD 4K Ergo IPS Monitor with USB Type-C™</a> monitor. Although LG markets this monitor in the same family as the rest of the Ultrafine series monitors, the pixel density on this one is <a href="https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/b9b81f2c">~140ppi</a> which falls short of Apple&rsquo;s standards for a <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/retina-display-3466732/">Retina display</a> on a computer screen (i.e. &gt;200ppi) and even falls short of other Ultrafine series monitors produced by LG.</p>
<p>The build quality, USB-C, HDR10, 4K, ergonomic features, colour profiles, and the price point made the buy a bit more appealing than others in my humble research. However, I was still a bit worried about the main thing I was looking for in a monitor, i.e. a monitor that can render text very well, which ultimately came down to the display panel&rsquo;s pixel density for me.</p>
<p>After a bit of hesitation, I decided to give this one a try, so I bought one.</p>
<p>Once setup &amp; connected, at first, I thought this was a mistake and wanted to return it before I got too comfortable with it — the text didn&rsquo;t look crisp the way I wanted it. But, truth be told, everything else about this monitor was excellent and delivered on the promise without a doubt.</p>
<p>For the context, macOS has <a href="https://www.eizoglobal.com/support/compatibility/dpi_scaling_settings_mac_os_x/">fractional scaling</a>, which means your text is going to look a little blurry in most of the default resolutions available for the display and to compensate for this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/387140/what-is-the-difference-between-the-different-font-smoothing-levels-on-macos">Font Smoothing</a> exists. Also, using 1x scaling on a 32-inch 4K monitor was not an option.</p>
<p>So, I started playing with different display resolutions to try and see what mimics a &ldquo;good&rdquo; rendering for this monitor given the distance from the eye &amp; the viewing angle of my setup. After much trial &amp; error, I felt<code>2304x1296</code> resolution worked very well for my setup (i.e., at <code>1.6666...</code> scaling factor). Oh, I used <a href="https://www.thnkdev.com/QuickRes/">QuickRes</a> to try unlisted resolutions quite easily, by the way but you can even set it directly via <a href="https://www.alphr.com/custom-resolution-mac-osx/">System Preferences</a> if you can&rsquo;t be bothered to install an app.</p>
<p>I did try the different brightness/contrast/sharpness levels in my honest effort to find my <em>perfect</em> setting, but the default values always did the trick for me in most cases. I think the &ldquo;Mode 4&rdquo; Gamma mode worked best to compensate for the overly bright whites.</p>
<p>I also explored various levels of Font Smoothing using a simple app called <a href="https://www.fontsmoothingadjuster.com">Font Smoothing Adjuster</a>, and to me default &lsquo;medium&rsquo; setting looked the best.</p>
<p>Finally, below is what I settled on (to those 0.0001% of us out there who&rsquo;re as pedantic on this topic as me):</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolution set at<code>2304x1296</code></li>
<li>Gamma mode set on &ldquo;Mode 4&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sharpness set to default</li>
<li>No changes to font smoothing (left it at default)</li>
<li><a href="https://lunar.fyi">Lunar</a> app to control the brightness/control levels automatically follow the MBP built-in display&rsquo;s ambient sensor.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been on this configuration for a while and occasionally rant about the blurry text on a few apps but I think this is it, perhaps I will some day find a <em>perfect</em> monitor that fits my budget but for now I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it.</p>
